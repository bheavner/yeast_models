CURRENT VERSION: 6.02

three versions of the network are made available
* yeast_x.yz.xml, a model for use in flux analyses, in FBC format [http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals/Flux_Constraints]
* yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml, the same model, in Cobra format [http://opencobra.sf.net/]
* yeast_x.yz_recon.xml, a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is experimental evidence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKSUM  

maximal growth rate: 0.13364 flux units

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSION SBML TO TEXT FILE

can be performed for example using the Cobra toolbox and commands

>> model = readCbModel('yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml',inf);
>> writeCbModel(model,'text','yeast_x.yz.txt');

though this is not recommended as semantic annotations may be lost.
