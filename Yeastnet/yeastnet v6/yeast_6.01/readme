CURRENT VERSION: 6.01

two versions of the network are made available
* yeast_x.yz_model.xml, a model for use in flux analyses
* yeast_x.yz_recon.xml, a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is with experimental evidence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKSUM  

maximal growth rate: 0.13364 flux units

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSION SBML TO TEXT FILE

can be performed for example using the Cobra toolbox (http://opencobra.sf.net/) and commands

>> model = readCbModel('yeast_modelNumber.xml',inf);
>> writeCbModel(model,'text','yeast_modelNumber.txt');

though this is not recommended as semantic annotations may be lost.
