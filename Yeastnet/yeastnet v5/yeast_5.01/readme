CURRENT VERSION: 5

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKSUM  

maximal growth rate: 0.091 flux units

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSION SBML TO TEXT FILE

can be performed for example using the Cobra toolbox (http://opencobra.sf.net/) and commands

>> model = readCbModel('yeast_modelNumber.xml',inf);
>> writeCbModel(model,'text','yeast_modelNumber.txt');

though this is not recommended as semantic annotations may be lost.

UPDATES

yeast 5.01: 21 nov 2011
* reversed exchange reactions for compatibilty with some Cobra functions
* unconstrained alcohol dehydrogenase (ethanol) reaction to allow growth on ethanol

yeast 5: 20 sep 2011
* large increase in coverage, particularly with regard to sphingolipid metabolism
* increased compatibility with Cobra toolbox
* model can consume glucose (rate 1 flux unit), and ammonium, H+, iron(2+), oxygen, phosphate, potassium, sodium, sulphate, water (unlimited rate) 
* no longer releasing in old SBML format - get the latest http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
* contributors: Ben Heavner, Brandon Barker, Tunahan Cakir, Nicolas Le Novere, Chuan Lu, Hanan Messiha, Naglis Malys, Neil Swainston

yeast 4.05: 11 aug 2010
* final yeast 4 release 
* published in BMC Sys Bio 
* addition of lipid metabolism 
* Cobra format (http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/) allowing contraint-based analyses to be performed
* following iMM904 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-3-37), the ATP requirements of the cell are fixed at 1, and the the model can consume
- oxygen (rate 2)
- glucose (rate 10)
- ammonium, [H+], iron(2+), phosphate, potassium, sodium, sulphate, [water] (unlimited)
