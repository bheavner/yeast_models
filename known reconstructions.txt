   to set up flux balance models using different assumptions (ie, biomass,
   reversibility, lumping, de-compartmentalizing)
 - note indicates taht iIN800 published while went to press

iMM904 - 2009 - Mo et al. doi:10.1186/1752-0509-3-37
 - update to iND750
 - analyzed with constraint-based sampling approach (rather than max biomass)
 - re-evaluated iND750 reactions and GPR associations
 - minimal media conditions
 - simulated WT growth aerobic and anaerobic carbon-limited chemostat
 - similar to iFF708 validation

 - "Reactions from previous S. cerevisiae networks associated with quinone, 
   beta-alanine, and riboflavin biosynthetic pathways were essentially
   inferred from known reaction mechanisms based on reactions in previous 
   network reconstructions of E. coli"
 - "While the full gene complement in iMM904 greatly increased the number of 
   true viable predictions, the full model also made significantly more 
   false viable predictions compared with reduced iMM904 and iLL672 
   predictions."

 - focus on integrating info from public databases: Ensembl, SwissProt,
   IntAct, KEGG, iND750, RefSeq
 - model available as SBML, but simulation code/methods not included in
   pub
 - Table 3 gives sources of viable and inviable mutant strain info for 
   comparison

   even distribution)

iMM904bs - 2011 - Szappanos et al. doi:10.1038/ng.846
 - apply machine learning approach to refine NAD metabolism in iMM904
 - changes allowed: modify reversibility, remove reactions, altering biomass
   requirements
 - omitting glycogen from biomass corrected genetic interaction prediction
   mistake; removing 2 reactions corrected 4 incorrect predictions in NAD
   biosynthetic pathway. Model contains 3 routes for NAD, including some
   which are present in E. coli, but don't have homologous yeast genes
 - found that "these results strongly suggest that the aspartate to NAD
   pathway is not present in yeast."
 - "We can draw several conclusions from these inconsistencies. First,
   the quality and completeness of the metabolic reconstruction should be
   improved."
